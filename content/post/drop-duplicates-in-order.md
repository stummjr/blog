Letâ€™s say you have a list containing all the URLs extracted from a web page and you want to get rid of duplicate URLs.

The most common way of achieving that might be building a set from that list, given that such operation automatically drops the duplicates. Something like:

```python
>>> urls = [
    'http://api.example.com/b',
    'http://api.example.com/a',
    'http://api.example.com/c',
    'http://api.example.com/b'
]
>>> set(urls)
{'http://api.example.com/a',
 'http://api.example.com/b',
 'http://api.example.com/c'}
```

The problem is that we just lost the original order of the list.

A good way to maintain the original order of the elements after removing the duplicates is by using this trick with [`collections.OrderedDict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict):

```python
>>> from collections import OrderedDict
>>> list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(urls).keys())
['http://api.example.com/b',
 'http://api.example.com/a',
 'http://api.example.com/c']
```

Cool, huh? Now letâ€™s dig into details to understand what the code above does.

`OrderedDict` is like a traditional Python `dict` with a (not so) slight difference: `OrderedDict` keeps the elementsâ€™ insertion order internally. This way, when we iterate over such an object, it will return its elements in the order in which theyâ€™ve been inserted.

Now, letâ€™s break down the operations to understand whatâ€™s going on:

```python
>>> odict = OrderedDict.fromkeys(urls)
```

The [`fromkeys()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter.fromkeys) method creates a dictionary using the values passed as its first parameters as the keys and the second parameter as its values (or `None` if we pass nothing, as we did).

As a result we get:

```python
>>> odict
OrderedDict([('http://api.example.com/b', None),
             ('http://api.example.com/a', None),
             ('http://api.example.com/c', None)])
```

Now that we have a dictionary with the URLs as the keys, we can call the `keys()` method to get only a sequence containing the URLs:

```python
>>> list(odict.keys())
['http://api.example.com/b',
 'http://api.example.com/a',
 'http://api.example.com/c']
```

Easy like that. ðŸ˜€
