I'm Valdir, a software developer passionate about Python, automation and writing.

My background includes web development with Django & Vue.js, large scale web crawling with Scrapy and years of teaching and mentoring experience.

I love sharing knowledge and writing, and this blog is my attempt to do it more often.

Besides programming, there are some other things I love:

- Watching and playing basketball;
- Taking nature photographies;
- Reading dystopian novels;
- Just being under water.

I run another blog in Brazilian Portuguese, my mother tongue: https://pythonhelp.wordpress.com/
