Hi! I'm Valdir (pronounced as *val-geer*), a software developer from Brazil.

If you've reached out this page, you're probably at least a little interested to learn more about me. So here we go:

My professional background includes web development with Python (Django, DRF, Sanic), Vue.js, several AWS technologies, large scale web crawling with Scrapy and years of teaching and mentoring experience.

I love sharing knowledge and writing, and this blog is my attempt to do it more often.

Besides programming, here are some of the other things that I love to do:

- Writing about technical stuff;
- Surfing and skating;
- Taking landscape photographies;
- Reading dystopian novels;
- Just being under water.

I used to run another blog in Brazilian Portuguese: https://pythonhelp.wordpress.com/
