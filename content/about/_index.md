I'm Valdir (pronounced as *val-geer*), a software developer passionate about Python, automation and writing.

My background includes web development with Django & Vue.js, several AWS technologies, large scale web crawling with Scrapy and years of teaching and mentoring experience.

I love sharing knowledge and writing, and this blog is my attempt to do it more often.

Besides programming, here are some of the other things that I love to do:

- Writing about technical stuff;
- Watching and playing basketball;
- Taking nature photographies;
- Reading dystopian novels;
- Just being under water.

I run another blog in Brazilian Portuguese: https://pythonhelp.wordpress.com/
